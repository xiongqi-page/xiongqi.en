      <h1>Wei's Dream</h1>
      <p>That night, Wei fell asleep by a stream, lulled by the water gliding over the stones.</p>
      <p>The mist rose gently, and he found himself in a garden paved with tiles. It seemed narrower than he remembered, as though some pathways had faded away; he counted sixty-four.</p>
      <p>On one of them stood the General. The walls of the pavilion that once sheltered him had vanished, and he gazed at the horizon, free. With a gentle gesture, he dismissed one of his two Advisors, who bowed before leaving the garden along a bamboo path. The Elephants stirred in turn, slow and silent, until they dissolved into the mist.</p>
      <p>Then, from the river, two great Pandas emerged and took the vacant places. Behind them, three additional Soldiers rose from the reeds to join their comrades.</p>
      <p>It was then that a woman appeared, as though sculpted from the vapour: the Empress. She moved now in straight lines, now in furtive sidesteps. And under her gaze, even the humblest soldier seemed called to surpass the role he had been given.</p>
      <p>Wei tried to speak, but the woman of mist placed a finger on his lips, and whispered:</p>
      <blockquote><p>Remember.</p></blockquote>
      <p>When he awoke, dawn was filtering through the stems. In the damp earth, Wei discovered he had traced a perfect square, marked the position of each piece, and drawn a line for the river. Half of the drawing was covered by the stream's water, exactly up to that line—as though the dream and the world had met.</p>
      <p>He showed this sketch to his family, then to the entire village.</p>
      <p>Some saw in it <a href="../" title="Xiongqi Rules">merely the modernisation of an ancient game</a>, others the memory of a dream they thought they had forgotten.</p>
