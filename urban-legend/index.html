        <h1>Xiongqi Urban Legend</h1>
      </header>

      <p>
        Under the silent night's canopy, beneath stars twinkling against a shy moon veiled by wandering clouds, a peasant slumbered into a dream both mystifying and mesmerizing.
        Gradually, a mist cleared, unveiling a serene assembly of pandas moving towards him with calm grace.
        These gentle beings, emblems of peace and serenity, bore an unvoiced prophecy, a whisper from beyond.
      </p>

      <p>
        As though emerging directly from the fog, Goddess He Xiangu materialized, her glow slicing through the nocturnal haze.
        Encountering her was both a profound privilege and a cryptic riddle.
        Struck by awe, the peasant was enveloped in a wave of deep veneration.
      </p>

      <p>
        <q>Those who adapt with the times are blessed,</q> intoned the goddess, her voice an ethereal harmony.
        <q>Now is the moment for Xiangqi to stride into a new chapterâ€”modernizing while respecting its rich past. A crucial innovation is required: a fifth major piece, the linchpin of this era's dawn.</q>
      </p>

      <p>
        Stirred by the revelation, the peasant hesitantly sought clarity, his voice quivering with a mix of awe and doubt.
        How was it possible that he, so modest and mortal, was chosen for such a grand endeavor?
      </p>

      <p>
        With a smile that seemed to illuminate centuries, He Xiangu gently revealed her hand.
        A scene unfolded within its glow: a horse, bounding with the nimble elegance of a rabbit.
      </p>

      <p>
        This spectacle transcended mere physical prowess or speed.
        It exuded an enchanting suppleness, a captivating adaptability - traits crucial for the seamless interplay within the grand tapestry of existence.
        Emerging like a profound symbol from the depths of mystery, it signified not only swiftness but the sophisticated skill to navigate through life's intricacies with fairness and cohesion.
      </p>

      <p>
        These principles, the bedrock of a society where diverse voices unite in concord, echoed a timeless dream: the emergence of equitable, wise leadership founded on the pillars of mutual esteem and collective insight.
      </p>

      <p>
        Awakening, the peasant was engulfed in confusion, the dawn's first light washing over him.
        The dream lingered, both remote and intensely present, a mystery cloaked in night's fog.
        Yet, from within, surged a compelling energy, urging him towards action.
      </p>

      <p>
        With divine inspiration as his guide, he embarked on his task with invigorated purpose.
        Led by an unseen hand, he crafted the piece as shown by He Xiangu: a seamless blend of equine strength and leporine grace.
        This creation, born of celestial vision and mortal craft, heralded a new chapter for Xiangqi, a fusion of heritage and progress in a game set to enchant future generations.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thus was born <a href="../" title="Panda Chess">Xiongqi</a>, not just as a game, but as the symbol of an evolution, inspired by ancestral wisdom and the courage of those who dare to dream.
