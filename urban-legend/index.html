        <h1>Xiongqi Urban Legend</h1>
      </header>

      <p>
        Under the silent canopy of night, beneath stars twinkling against a shy moon veiled by wandering clouds, a peasant descended into a dream both mystifying and mesmerizing.
        Gradually, the mist parted, revealing a serene assembly of pandas moving toward him with calm grace.
        These gentle beings, emblems of peace and serenity, carried an unvoiced prophecy, a whisper from beyond the veil.
      </p>

      <p>
        As if emerging directly from the fog, Goddess He Xiangu materialized, her radiance cutting through the nocturnal haze.
        To encounter her was both a profound privilege and a cryptic riddle.
        Struck with awe, the peasant found himself enveloped in a wave of deep veneration.
      </p>

      <p>
        <q>Those who adapt with the changing times are blessed,</q> intoned the goddess, her voice an ethereal harmony.
        <q>Now is the moment for Xiangqi to stride into a new chapter—modernizing while honoring its rich heritage. A crucial innovation is required: a fifth major piece, the linchpin of this era's dawn.</q>
      </p>

      <p>
        Moved by the revelation, the peasant hesitantly sought clarity, his voice quivering with a blend of reverence and doubt.
        How could it be that he, so humble and mortal, was chosen for such a grand endeavor?
      </p>

      <p>
        With a smile that seemed to illuminate across centuries, He Xiangu gently revealed her hand.
        Within its glow, a scene unfolded: a horse, bounding with the nimble elegance of a rabbit.
      </p>

      <p>
        This spectacle transcended mere physical prowess or speed.
        It exuded an enchanting suppleness, a captivating adaptability—qualities essential for the harmonious interplay within the grand tapestry of existence.
        Emerging like a profound symbol from the depths of mystery, it signified not only swiftness but the sophisticated art of navigating through life's complexities with fairness and cohesion.
      </p>

      <p>
        These principles, the foundation of a society where diverse voices unite in concord, echoed an ageless dream: the emergence of equitable, wise leadership founded on the pillars of mutual respect and collective insight.
      </p>

      <p>
        Upon awakening, the peasant was engulfed in bewilderment as dawn's first light washed over him.
        The dream lingered, both distant and intensely present, a mystery shrouded in night's mist.
        Yet, from within surged a compelling energy, urging him toward action.
      </p>

      <p>
        With divine inspiration as his guide, he embarked on his task with renewed purpose.
        Led by an unseen hand, he crafted the piece as shown by He Xiangu: a seamless blend of equine strength and leporine grace.
        This creation, born of celestial vision and mortal craft, heralded a new chapter for Xiangqi, a fusion of heritage and progress in a game destined to enchant future generations.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thus was born <a href="../" title="Panda Chess">Xiongqi</a>, not merely as a game, but as the emblem of an evolution, inspired by ancestral wisdom and the courage of those who dare to dream.
