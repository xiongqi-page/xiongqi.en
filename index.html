          <h2>1. General concepts</h2>

          <ul>
            <li>The game is played between two sides: the South side and the North side.</li>
            <li>The South side always plays the first move.</li>
            <li>The sides then take turns, one move each.</li>
            <li>A move consists of moving a single piece of one's own side, according to the rules described below.</li>
            <li>The terminal piece of a side is its general, or its dragon if a transformation has occurred.</li>
            <li>Capturing the terminal piece immediately ends the game.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>1.1 Check and checkmate (informative notions)</h3>

          <p>
            In Xiongqi, <strong>check</strong> and <strong>checkmate</strong> exist,
            but these notions are purely <strong>informative</strong>:
            they do not restrict the allowed moves.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Check</strong>: a situation where the terminal piece of a side
              (general or dragon) is attacked by at least one enemy piece.
              It is courteous to announce <q>check</q>, but not mandatory.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Checkmate</strong>: a check situation with no possible defense.
              The side in checkmate is in a losing position;
              it is customary to resign rather than wait for the capture.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Nothing forbids playing a move that places or leaves one's own terminal piece in check.
            Such a move remains legal, but the opponent can then capture that terminal piece
            and immediately win the game.
          </p>

          <h3>1.2 Definition of a legal move</h3>

          <p>
            In the rest of this document, a <strong>legal move</strong> is a move that respects:
            (1) the rules of movement and capture,
            (2) the rules of face-to-face and promotion,
            and (3) the prohibition of repetition.
            The check situation is not part of this definition.
          </p>

            <h3>2.1 Board</h3>

            <ul>
              <li>Xiongqi is played on a board of 8 columns by 8 rows (8×8).</li>
              <li>From the South side's point of view, the columns are named from left to right: a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h.</li>
              <li>From the South side's point of view, the rows are numbered from bottom to top: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.</li>
              <li>The South side occupies the rows close to 1, the North side those close to 8.</li>
              <li>The <q>river</q> is located between rows 4 and 5.</li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <section id="pieces">
            <h3>2.2 Pieces</h3>

            <p>At the start of the game, each side has the following pieces:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>1 general</li>
              <li>1 advisor</li>

              <li>2 cannons</li>
              <li>8 soldiers</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              The <strong>dragon</strong> is not placed at the start: it only appears if the two generals end up face-to-face.
              The <strong>empress</strong> is not placed at the start: it only appears through soldier promotion.

            <p>
              By convention, each piece type is associated with a character and a distinct Latin abbreviation
              depending on the side (uppercase for South, lowercase for North).
              These conventions are useful in notation and implementation, but do not modify the rules.

            <ul>
              <li>On their turn, a side moves exactly one piece of their own side.</li>
              <li>A move takes a piece from a starting square to a destination square.</li>
              <li>The destination square must be either empty or occupied by an enemy piece.</li>
              <li>A piece can never move to a square occupied by a piece of its own side.</li>
              <li>
                If the destination square is occupied by an enemy piece, that piece is captured:
                it is removed from the board and the moving piece takes its place.
              </li>
              <li>
                Unless otherwise stated in a piece's description, a piece cannot jump:
                all squares between the starting square and the destination square must be empty.

              A <strong>position</strong> includes the board configuration and the side whose turn it is to play.

            <p>
              A move is said to be <strong>repetitive</strong> if it meets these two conditions:

            <ol>
              <li>it recreates a position that has already occurred during the game;</li>

                it is identical to the move that previously led to that position
                (same piece, same starting square, same destination square, same promotion choice if applicable).

            </ol>

            <p>
              A repetitive move is forbidden. If a player makes a repetitive move, they immediately lose the game.
